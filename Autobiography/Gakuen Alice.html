          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>For Mikan, there was no better friend than Hotaru (though Hotaru sometimes seems to have other sentiments). They often played together. But Hotaru is a very special child, and she agrees to go to a school in Tokyo which the government reserved only for geniuses. This left a very lonely Mikan at home. When Hotaru fails to keep her promise and come home for holidays, her young friend is very disappointed and rather angry. But upon overhearing a conversation between Hotaru's mother and a teacher, Mikan realizes that her friend's reasons for leaving might not have been what they seemed. So Mikan takes it upon herself to run away and go to Hotaru's school. <br><br>There she discovers the so-called "genius academy" is actually a school for people gifted with special powers called "alices". Her friend Hotaru is one of these, and after a chance encounter with a teacher, Mikan suddenly finds herself enrolled.
